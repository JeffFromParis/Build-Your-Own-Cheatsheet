#Build Your Own Cheatsheet
*A Project by Jeff Vergne*

This project is part of the **Fullstack Engineer Career** path from CodeCademy

## Objective
In this project, Iâ€™ll be building my own reference cheat sheet to help me build more websites in the future! Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference are often my own notes and projects.

## Technology
Written in HTML5 / CSS3
